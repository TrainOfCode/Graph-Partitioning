# Graph-Partitioning
Exploration of Graph Partitioning Algorithms

For an example of using the algorithms invoke the command `make`

Help in using each file can also be invoked with the -h flag, i.e. `python3 LGD.py -h`

Note, any file names given as arguments should not have file extensions apart of the name. I.e.
`python3 LGD.py -i input -o output` as opposed to `python3 LGD.py -i input.mtx -o output.html`

Graphs should be in `.mtx` format
